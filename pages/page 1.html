    Galaxies consist of stars, planets, and vast clouds of gas and dust, all bound together by gravity. The largest 
    <br>
    contain trillions of stars and can be more than a million light-years across. The smallest can contain a few thousand
    <br>
    stars and span just a few hundred light-years. Most large galaxies have supermassive black holes at their centers, 
    <br>
    some with billions of times the Sun's mass. 
    <br><br><br>
    Galaxies come in a variety of shapes, mostly spirals and ellipticals, as well as those with less orderly appearances,
    <br>
    usually dubbed irregular. Most galaxies are between 10 billion and 13.6 billion years old. Some are almost as old as 
    <br>
    the universe itself, which formed around 13.8 billion years ago. Astronomers think the youngest known galaxy formed 
    <br>
    approximately 500 million years ago.
    <br><br><br>
    Galaxies can organize into groups of about 100 or fewer members held together by their mutual gravity. Larger structures,
    <br>
    called clusters, may contain thousands of galaxies. Groups and clusters can be arranged in superclusters, which are not 
    <br>
    gravitationally bound. Superclusters, empty voids, “walls” of galaxies, and other large-scale structures make up the cosmic
    <br>
    web of matter in the universe.

<p style="color: white; text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">
    Our home galaxy is called the Milky Way. It’s a spiral galaxy with a disk of stars spanning more than 100,000 light-years. 
    <br>
    Earth is located along one of the galaxy’s spiral arms, about halfway from the center. Our solar system takes about 240 
    <br>
    million years to orbit the Milky Way just once. From our perspective on Earth, the Milky Way looks like a faint, milky 
    <br>
    band of light arcing across the entire sky, which is how it got its name. This feature marks the central disk of our 
    <br>
    home galaxy seen edge on.

    <br><br>
    The Milky Way sits in a neighborhood with over 50 other galaxies called the Local Group. Its members range in size from
    <br>
    dwarf galaxies (smaller galaxies with up to a few billion stars) to Andromeda, our nearest large galactic neighbor. The
    <br>
    Local Group sits just off the edge of the Virgo cluster and is part of the Laniakea supercluster.

<p style="color: white; text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">
    Scientists sometimes categorize galaxies based on their shapes and physical features. Other classifications organize 
    <br>
    galaxies by the activity in their central regions – powered by a supersized black hole – and the angle at which we view them.

Our Milky Way is one example of a broad class of galaxies defined by the presence of spiral arms. These galaxies resemble giant 
<br>
rotating pinwheels with a pancake-like disk of stars and a central bulge or tight concentration of stars. The spiral arms can be
<br>
wound tightly or loosely, and some cannot be seen from Earth because we view the galaxy from the side, edge on.
<br><br><br>
Spiral galaxies are surrounded by halos, mixtures of old stars, star clusters, and dark matter – invisible material that does not
<br>
emit or reflect light but still has a gravitational pull on other matter. The youngest stars form in gas-rich arms, while older 
<br>
stars can be found throughout the disk and within the bulge and halo. Both the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxies belong to a 
<br>
subtype known as barred spirals, which make up two-thirds of the group. Barred spirals sport ribbons of stars, gas, and dust that
<br>
cut across their centers. Scientists think the presence of a bar indicates that a galaxy has reached full maturity.<br><br><br>

        Elliptical galaxies have shapes that range from completely round to oval. They are less common than spiral galaxies.
        <br>
        Unlike spirals, elliptical galaxies usually contain little gas and dust and show very little organization or structure. 
        <br>
        
        The stars orbit around the core in random directions and are generally older than those in spiral galaxies since little 
        <br>
        
        of the gas needed to form new stars remains. Scientists think elliptical galaxies originate from collisions and mergers 
        <br>
        
        with spirals.<br><br>

    <p style="color: white; text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">
        Irregular galaxies have unusual shapes, like toothpicks, rings, or even little groupings of stars. They range from dwarf
        <br>
        irregular galaxies with 100 million times the Sun’s mass to large ones weighing 10 billion solar masses. Astronomers think
        <br>
        these galaxies’ odd shapes are sometimes the result of interactions with others. For example, one spiral galaxy passing 
        <br>
        another with a stronger gravitational pull could lose some of its material, become distorted, and morph into a new shape.
        <br>
        Some, like gas-rich dwarf galaxies, may be new, formed by material pulled from such encounters. Or perhaps when galaxies 
        <br>
        collide, they create a larger, oddly shaped mashup. Some scientists theorize that some large irregular galaxies could 
        <br>
        represent an intermediate step between spiral and elliptical galaxies.
        <br><br><br>
        Irregular galaxies born from galaxy interactions or collisions typically host a mix of older and younger stars, depending
        <br>
        on the characteristics and composition of the original galaxies. Irregular galaxies may also hold significant amounts of 
        <br>
        gas and dust – essential ingredients for making new stars. <br><br>
